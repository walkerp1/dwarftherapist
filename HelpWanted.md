#DwarfTherapist seeks new permanent maintainer

# HelpWanted #

After over a year of work on DwarfTherapist, I (Trey aka chmod) have decided to move on. DT was a fun tool to write, and it has been great meeting so many cool people from around the DF community.

## What this means for DT ##
I do not plan any more official releases of DT. For DT to continue, a permanent maintainer who wants to run the project needs to step forward.

## If you're interested ##
You should know C++ and the Qt framework. There is actually very little code that touches the RAM of DF, almost 100% of DT is GUI code.

If this sounds like something you'd like to take on, come find me on IRC (#dwarftherapist on freenode) and we can work out details there.
