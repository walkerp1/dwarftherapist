**DwarfTherapist Vision Statement**

_What DwarfTherapist is:_

DwarfTherapist is a companion application to DwarfFortress. DwarfTherapist is intended and designed to be primarily a decision support tool to reduce or eliminate in-game screen transitions to find information and present game data in a concise, flexible, and easy-to-understand manner.  Secondary design intentions are to assist in otherwise cumbersome or tedious workflows (such as changing labors assignments) and allow quick, easy editing of these elements within DwarfTherapist whose changes can then can be written to the game. In short, DwarfTherapist is intended to make playing Dwarf Fortress simpler and easier, getting the player back in to the action and off pause as quickly as possible so you can do much more important things like watch a room full of your baby dorfs or royals take a soak in a relaxing magma pour.

_What DwarfTherapist is not:_

DwarfTherapist is not intended to undermine the game designers’ intentions of how the game mechanics, balance, or logic works and as such DwarfTherapist as not a hacking, cheating, or ‘game modding’ tool. DwarfTherapist also is not intended to create a ‘game outside of the game’ in manners that extend game functionality (such as command-chaining or macros) or otherwise introduce new gaming elements outside of Dwarf Fortress that are not immediately and conspicuously tied to the primary and secondary design intentions.
