### Q: Why isn't the latest version of DF supported yet? ###
While I have made a substantial effort to provide tools that let users help themselves (MappingNewVersions), those tools may not always be sufficient. I do work on DT in my spare time, I do have a paying job, a wife, and a mortgage. So I'm not always as quick as most users would like when releasing support for new versions the hour they come out.

Rest assured, when new DF versions come out, I know about it, but may not have the time right at that second to drop everything and bang out a new release. I appreciate your patience during the lulls. Donations tend to work better than begging as I can show the receipts to my wife :)

### Q: Why is there no auto-refresh/real-time information display in DwarfTherapist? ###
Because of the VisionStatement. **DwarfTherapist is intended only as a decision support tool for DF.** Real-time information display adds very little to the core goal of decision support. The feature is technically easy to implement, but I see it as a gateway feature. I mean "gateway" in the sense of marijuana here.

It's simply a feature that leads to hundreds of new feature requests that deal with real-time information display. There are already several visualizers that have based their core features around real-time display. DwarfTherapist is not one of those.

I do see in the far future a sister-utility for DwarfTherapist that shows real-time updates about your fort, as well as historical time-series data, however it would be separate from DT, and be read-only.

### Q: What happened to the DFHack version of DwarfTherapist? ###
The DFHack version was never an official release. During a 5 month hiatus from the project, some folks stepped in to make interim versions of DwarfTherapist using the DFHack library. While I appreciate people liking DT enough to continue development in my absence, the DFHack version took DT down a road I was not ready to take it down. I will be exploring DFHack integration as an official plan in the future. I wish things could have been handled much differently, but that is the history and the current status.

### Q: How come my feature request was never implemented? ###
Because it wasn't put into the bug tracker. http://code.google.com/p/dwarftherapist/issues/entry
