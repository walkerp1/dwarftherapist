# Dwarf Therapist #

## Overview ##
Dwarf Therapist is an extension application for the fantastic game [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/).
DF is a great game. And it's fun to manage dwarves with keyboard menus until about the 50th one shows up. If you're starting to get overwhelmed you need therapist in your life.
