# Building Dwarf Therapist #
Just in case you're a masochist, and refuse to download a binary, or maybe you just want to help out on the project: You'll probably appreciate some help in compiling this thing.

### Dependencies ###
  * a C++ compiler (developed under win32 using Visual Studio 2008)
  * [Qt 4.5.2](http://www.qtsoftware.com/downloads) (I use the LGPL version compiled with MSVC)
  * [libqxt-0.5.0](http://www.libqxt.org/) (used for logging, and checkable list items)
  * [qtcolorpicker](http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/appdev/add-on-products/catalog/4/Widgets/qtcolorpicker) (used for custom color dialog)

So go download all of those, and build/install them.
